This is a sample full-stack web app I built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node). The idea is simple: users can book a laundry pickup online by filling out a form and choosing a convenient time. Then, a laundry agent visits their home, checks the weight of the clothes, picks them up, and delivers them after cleaning. The system supports different laundry packages like: Full Package (wash + dry), Wash Package (wash only), Dry Package (drying only), Heavy Package (for big orders). Users can view their current and past orders, and also check About Us and Contact Us info. There's also a basic admin panel (with predefined login) where the admin can manage laundry packages. Features real-time notifications and admin dashboard.
